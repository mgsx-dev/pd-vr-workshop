## About the events graph

TODOC : ordering right to left convention

TODOC : list vs message ... ?
  
## Envelops and messages

Until then we have a continuous signal. Now we want to trigger some sound.

Note that envelops are not restricted to amplitude modulation but could be used to shape frequencies or any other things.

see examples.

## Metro and random

## Events ordering

* Ordering by convention from right to left.
* The "Hot" input vs "Cold" inputs concept.


## Links between audio graph and events flow

* from events to audio :
  * TODOC sig~, line~, vline~, [filters]~
* from audio to events :
  * TODOC env~, threshold~, ...
